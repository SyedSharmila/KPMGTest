Challenge #1
-----------------
A 3 tier environment is a common setup. Use a tool of your choosing/familiarity create these resources. Please remember we will not be judged on the outcome but more focusing on the approach, style and reproducibility.

Answer
Here we can use Kubernetes for container platform, for hosting it on EC2 we can use terraform as code on Cloud platform.

Challenge #2
------------
Summary
We need to write code that will query the meta data of an instance within aws and provide a json formatted output. The choice of language and implementation is up to you.

Bonus Points
The code allows for a particular data key to be retrieved individually

Hints
•	Aws Documentation
•	Azure Documentation
•	Google Documentation

Answer
#!/bin/bash

ssh -i key-file ec2-user@instance-ip

cd /run/cloud/
cat instance-data.json

done

Challenge #3
------------
We have a nested object, we would like a function that you pass in the object and a key and get back the value. How this is implemented is up to you.

Example Inputs
object = {“a”:{“b”:{“c”:”d”}}}
key = a/b/c

object = {“x”:{“y”:{“z”:”a”}}}
key = x/y/z
value = a

Hints
We would like to see some tests. A quick read to help you along the way
We would expect it in any other language apart from elixir.
Again thank you for spending your precious time on our challenge.

Answer
# Python3 code to demonstrate working of
# Extract values of Particular Key in Nested Values
# Using list comprehension

# initializing dictionary
test_dict = {'Gfg' : {"a" : 7, "b" : 9, "c" : 12},
'is' : {"a" : 15, "b" : 19, "c" : 20},
'best' :{"a" : 5, "b" : 10, "c" : 2}}

# printing original dictionary
print("The original dictionary is : " + str(test_dict))

# initializing key
temp = "c"

# using item() to extract key value pair as whole
res = [val[temp] for key, val in test_dict.items() if temp in val]

# printing result
print("The extracted values : " + str(res))
